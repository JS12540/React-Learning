# React-Learning

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.
